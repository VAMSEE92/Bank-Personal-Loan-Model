# Bank Personal Loan Model
### Context:
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of
converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as
depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a
healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing
department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success
ratio with minimal budget.
### Objective
The goal of this project is to help a bank predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal
loans. So that the bank can easily direct their services to the potential customer who is more likely to buy personal loan
